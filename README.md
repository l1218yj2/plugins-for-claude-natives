## Plugin Details

### agent-council

[![Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZUT_55FeQXM/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ZUT_55FeQXM)

**Summon multiple AI models to debate your question and reach a consensus.**

When you're facing a tough decision or want diverse perspectives, this plugin queries multiple AI agents (Gemini CLI, GPT, Codex) in parallel and synthesizes their opinions into a single, balanced answer.

**Trigger phrases:**
- "summon the council"
- "ask other AIs"
- "what do other models think?"

**How it works:**
1. Your question is sent to multiple AI agents simultaneously
2. Each agent provides its perspective
3. Claude synthesizes the responses into a consensus view with noted disagreements

```bash
# Example
User: "summon the council - should I use TypeScript or JavaScript for my new project?"
```

---

### clarify

[![Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/N50O5S3sOrA/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/N50O5S3sOrA)

**Turn vague requirements into precise, actionable specifications.**

Before writing code based on ambiguous instructions, this plugin conducts a structured interview to extract exactly what you need. No more assumptions, no more rework.

**Trigger phrases:**
- "/clarify"
- "clarify requirements"
- "what do I mean by..."

**The process:**
1. **Capture** - Record the original requirement verbatim
2. **Question** - Ask targeted multiple-choice questions to resolve ambiguities
3. **Compare** - Present before/after showing the transformation
4. **Save** - Optionally save the clarified spec to a file

**Example transformation:**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Add a login feature" | Goal: Add username/password login with self-registration. Scope: Login, logout, registration, password reset. Constraints: 24h session, bcrypt, rate limit 5 attempts. |

### dev

**Scan developer communities for real opinions on any tech topic.**

Want to know what developers actually think about a framework, tool, or practice? This plugin searches Reddit, Hacker News, Dev.to, and Lobsters in parallel to gather diverse perspectives.

**Trigger phrases:**
- "developer reactions to..."
- "what do devs think about..."
- "community opinions on..."

**Output includes:**
- **Consensus** - Points mentioned across multiple sources
- **Controversy** - Where opinions diverge
- **Notable perspectives** - Unique insights from experienced devs
- **Platform temperature** - Overall sentiment by community

```bash
# Example
User: "What do developers think about React 19?"
```

---

### interactive-review

**Review Claude's plans and documents through a visual web interface.**

Instead of reading long markdown in the terminal, this plugin opens a browser-based UI where you can check/uncheck items, add comments, and submit structured feedback.

**Trigger phrases:**
- "/review"
- "review this plan"
- "let me check this"

**The flow:**
1. Claude generates a plan or document
2. A web UI opens automatically in your browser
3. Review each item with checkboxes and optional comments
4. Click Submit to send structured feedback back to Claude
5. Claude adjusts based on your approved/rejected items
